File Stealer-BTC-Dedupe-2.txt contains just over 50k BTC wallets that have been parsed from free or sample copies of Stealer Log data. No Stealer Logs were purchased for extracting this data.

Because a wallet is blindly enumerated they can range from either being searched for, interacted with and in some cases compromised.
